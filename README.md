**Note:** This plugin is currently in a beta phase. If you find any bugs / issues or have feature ideas please [create an issue](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/issues/new).

The **Design Tokens** plugin for figma allows you to export design tokens into a json format that can be used with the [Amazon style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) package. This allows you to transform your tokens to different languages / platforms like web, iOS or Android.

## Installation

<img src="https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/raw/main/_resources/Design%20Tokens%20Plugin%20Icon.png" width="50px"> 

1. Go to the [design tokens plugin page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/Design-Tokens)
2. Click on install in the top right corner

## Plugin usage
The plugin has a couple options in the menu items:
### `Design Tokens > Export Design Token File`
This creates a `.json` file with all design tokens from your Figma project. A dialog will open allowing you to save the file on your hard drive.

### `Design Tokens > Send Design Tokens to Url`
This triggers a request sending your tokens to a server. For this to work you must have configured a server to send your tokens to in the [plugin settings](#push-to-server).

### `Design Tokens > Settings`
Opens the settings view, which allows you to change all settings mentioned in the [settings](#settings) section below.

### `Design Tokens > Help`
Opens this documentation page.

## Transforming tokens using Amazon style dictionary
1. Clone the [design token transformer](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer) repositiory.
```cli
git clone https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer.git
```
2. Export your tokens using the plugin and place the json file in the `tokens` folder within the transformer repositry
3. Run `npm run transform-tokens` from the commandline
4. ðŸŽ‰ Your converted tokens should be in the `build` folder. For more customization options check out the [design token transformer documentation](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer)

## Creating Design Tokens
### Figma style design tokens
The plugin converts the styles you define in Figma into design tokens, this includes `Text Styles`, `Color Styles`, `Grid Styles` and `Effect Styles`.

Every property of a style will be converted to an individual token. For a `Text Styles` this may result in the following tokens (show as transformed css custom properties for readability).

```css
  --font-headline-3-font-size: 20;
  --font-headline-3-text-decoration: none;
  --font-headline-3-font-family: Roboto;
  --font-headline-3-font-style: italic;
  --font-headline-3-font-weight: 500;
  --font-headline-3-font-stretch: condensed;
  --font-headline-3-font-style-old: Medium Italic Condensed; /* only to preserve original value */
  --font-headline-3-letter-spacing: 2;
  --font-headline-3-line-height: 160;
  --font-headline-3-paragraph-indent: 5;
  --font-headline-3-paragraph-spacing: 8;
  --font-headline-3-text-case: uppercase;
```

#### Naming
Styles don't have to follow a specific naming convention. Any style will be exported into a design token, as long as it does not match the [`ignore pattern`](#ignoring-styles). 

This means you can name your styles `Headline` or `Foundation/Colors/Primary/Red/100` and either one works fine.

#### Ignoring styles
Styles you don't want to be exported as design tokens can be prefixed with an `_` underscore. For example a color style called `_readlining/line-color` will not be exported.

In the settings you can change the [prefix](#prefix-used-to-in-exclude-styles) for ignoring/including styles.


### Custom design tokens
The plugin also supports custom tokens for `borders`, `radii`, `sizes`, `spacing` & `motion`.

- Every custom design token must be directly within a top-level `Frame` with a name starting with `_tokens`. This means you have a structure like this: `page` > `_tokens/sizes` > `sizes/8`. Nesting is not possible at this point.
- The token itself has to have a name starting with `sizes`, `spacing`, `borders`, `radii` or `motion` and has to be a `Frame`, `Rectangle` or `Main Component`. This is so that the plugin can identify what is and what isn't a token.
- The token has to be a direct child of a `_token` frame

#### Sizes

To create a *sizes token*, do the following:

1. Create a `Frame` and name it `_tokens/sizes` 
2. Create another `Frame`, `Rectangle` or `Main Component` and set the width property to your `8`.
3. Name it `sizes/8`. Note, it is important to use the `sizes/` prefix.


The token will be exported, if you convert it to css the output would be something like this:

```css
  --sizes-8: 8;
```

#### Spacing

To create a *spacing token*, do the following:

1. Create a `Frame` and name it `_tokens/spacing` 
2. Create another `Frame`, `Rectangle` or `Main Component` and set the padding properties to `10` in the `auto layout`.
3. Name it `spacing/10`. Note, it is important to use the `spacing/` prefix.


The token will be exported, if you convert it to css the output would be something like this:

```css
  --spacing-10-top: 10;
  --spacing-10-right: 10;
  --spacing-10-bottom: 10;
  --spacing-10-left: 10;
```

#### Borders
To create a *border token*, do the following:

1. Create a `Frame` and name it `_tokens/borders` 
2. Create another `Frame`, `Rectangle` or `Main Component` and set the stroke property to your desired values.
3. Name it `borders/dashed-outside`. Note, it is important to use the `borders/` prefix.

The token will be exported, if you convert it to css the output would be something like this:

```css
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke-align: outside;
  --borders-dashed-outside-dash-pattern: 5,5,3,3;
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke-cap: none;
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke-join: miter;
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke-miter-limit: 4;
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke-weight: 1;
  --borders-dashed-outside-stroke: rgba(64, 255, 186, 1);
```

#### Radii
To create a *radius token*, do the following:

1. Create a `Frame` and name it `_tokens/radii` 
2. Create another `Frame`, `Rectangle` or `Main Component` and set the radius properties to your desired values.
3. Name it `radii/same-with-smoothing`. Note, it is important to use the `radii/` prefix.


The token will be exported, if you convert it to css the output would be something like this:

```css
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radius: 5;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radius-type: single;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radii-top-left: 5;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radii-top-right: 5;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radii-bottom-right: 5;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-radii-bottom-left: 5;
  --radii-same-with-smoothing-smoothing: 0.65;
```

#### Motion
Motion tokens are a combination of an `easing curve`, a `duration` and an animation type. 
To create a motion token follow this flow:

1. Create a new `Frame` called `_tokens/motion`
2. Create a new `Frame`, `Component` or `Rectangle`
3. Name it `motion/move-in`. Note, it is important to use the `motion/` prefix.
4. Enter `prototyping mode` and link the element `motion/move-in` to any other element.
5. Choose an `animation type`, `easing curve` and a `duration`

When exporting your tokens you will now get a set of properties for this motion set.

```css
  --motion-move-in-type: move_in;
  --motion-move-in-duration: 0.5;
  --motion-move-in-easing: ease-in;
  --motion-move-in-easing-function-x-1: 0.41999998688697815;
  --motion-move-in-easing-function-x-2: 1;
  --motion-move-in-easing-function-y-1: 0;
  --motion-move-in-easing-function-y-2: 1;
  --motion-move-in-direction: left;
```

### Available properties
To allow for maximum customizability I decided to provide all values that Figma provides. Many are not applicable to for example `css` but may be usable in other languages.

**Colors** are provided in `rgba` but can be converted using [Amazon style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).

## Settings

![Design Tokens plugin settings](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/raw/main/_resources/settings.png)

### Filename
This allows you to define the file name that is used when exporting tokens. The `.json` extension will be automatically appended to the name.
The filename will also be send to the server when sending design tokens to the server.

### Prefix (used to in-/exclude styles)
#### **Prefix**
You can change the prefix from `_` to anything, e.g. `_tokens`.   
#### **Exclude**
The toggle allows you to switch from `exclude` to `include` mode. This means that only prefixed styles will be exported. For example if you only wanted to export styles that are named `_tokens/...`.

**Note:** This setting only applies to Figma styles (colors, typography, grids & effects). It does not apply to custom tokens.

### Push to Server
When a `server url` is specified, the command `Send Design Tokens to Url` will send a `POST` request to the provided url.
The body of the request will look like the following:
```ts
  "event_type": "update-tokens", // or any string you defined
  "client_payload": { 
    "tokenFileName": "design-tokens.json", // this is the filename you define above
    "tokens": "{...}", // the stringified json object holding all your desing tokens
    "filename": "Design Tokens" // the Figma file name from which the tokens were exported
  }
```

#### **Event type**
This is the `event_type` property that is send in the body of the request with the `client_payload`.
#### **Server url**
The url the post request is send to. This must be SSL secured (using `https`) as Figma is a secure environment and thus does not allow non-secure requests.
A limitation that comes with Figma is that the server must allow access from any origin and send the following header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

##### Pushing to Github
If you push to github the server url must be in the format 
```
https://api.github.com/repo/:username/:repo/dispatches
```

For the repositiory `lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer` this would be:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer/dispatches
```

#### **Auth header**
This defines the authentication method used with the access token. The current choices are:
- `token` (used for github)
- `bearer` token
- `basic` auth
#### **Access token**
The token send using the authentication method defined above. Learn more about creating a [personal access token for github](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer#personal-access-token).

#### Github repo or custom server
You can use this feature to integrate tokens into your build pipeline. The ideal is to send tokens from Figma to a repository and automatically transform them. Depending on your setup you could either trigger a webhook on your product repos, create a new semversion on the tokens repo or notify the dev teams in another way.

To learn how to set this up using `github` and `actions` check out the documentation and code examples in the [design token transformer repositry](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer).
